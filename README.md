# 👋 Hi, I’m Kishore Katari

> *Turning raw data into decisions that actually matter.*

I’m a **Graduate student in Applied Computing** with a strong focus on **Data Analytics, Machine Learning, and AI-driven systems**. I work at the intersection of **data engineering and predictive modeling**, building solutions that don’t just analyze data—but **explain it, validate it, and drive action**.

From **real-time telemetry dashboards** to **NLP pipelines that filter noisy data**, I design end-to-end systems ready for **industry and startup environments**, where speed, ownership, and impact matter.

## 🚀 What I Work On
- 📊 **Data Analytics & Visualization** — fast, interpretable, decision-ready insights  
- 🤖 **Machine Learning & AI** — predictive modeling, NLP, feature engineering  
- 🛠️ **Data Engineering** — ETL pipelines, validation frameworks, clean data foundations  
- 🧠 **Applied AI** — sentiment analysis, telemetry analytics, real-world ML systems
